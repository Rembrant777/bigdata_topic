# Netty Topic 

In this project we try to learn netty framework from 3 tutorial materials: 

* code repo: [Netty Git Hub(branch-4.1)](https://github.com/netty/netty/tree/4.1/buffer/src/test/java/io/netty/buffer)


* book:[Netty Definitive Guide(2nd Edition)](https://www.amazon.com/Netty-Definitive-Guide-2nd-Netty%E6%9D%83%E5%A8%81%E6%8C%87%E5%8D%97%EF%BC%88%E7%AC%AC2%E7%89%88%EF%BC%89/dp/7121258013)
* code repo: [nettybook2](https://github.com/wuyinxian124/nettybook2)

* Actually most of the code examples from the `Netty Definitive Guide` are deprecated especially the interfaces and the abstract classes 
that required to implement when I need to implement a customized communication framework. 
So for now I have to terminate coding those examples, and in future delete those codes from the folder.


* book: [Netty in Action](https://www.amazon.com/Netty-Action-Norman-Maurer/dp/1617291471/ref=sr_1_2?crid=3AEY0KINCOAMJ&keywords=netty+in+action&qid=1698046707&s=books&sprefix=netty+in+acti%2Cstripbooks%2C422&sr=1-2)

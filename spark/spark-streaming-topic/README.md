# Spark Streaming Topic 

This folder contains two contents: 

1. how spark streaming integrated with different data middlewares like local file, hdfs file, redis, kafka, elasticsearch and hbase
2. how spark streaming implements customized receiver that supports different data sources 
3. spark streaming supports regular and advanced spark DStream operations
4. how spark streaming save data to different downstreams like, redis, kafka, elasticsearch and hbase 


For installation of different middle ware's simplisity we establish all the clusters in `Dockerfile` or `docker-compose.yml` those with minimum worker nodes (which performace cannot compare to product envs).
